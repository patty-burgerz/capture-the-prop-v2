Prop Hunt / Capture the Flag (Working Title)
Why This Game Exists

Prop Hunt might be one of the funniest game ideas ever created.

Turning into a chair. Hiding in plain sight. Watching someone walk past you three times while you try not to laugh. It’s brilliant — for a while.

But almost every attempt to bring Prop Hunt back runs into the same problem:

It’s a zero-sum game.

Props get all the fun.
Hunters get the frustration.

Once the novelty wears off, being a hunter often turns into a slow guessing game — shooting random objects, second-guessing everything, and hoping the props make a mistake. Meanwhile, props shrink into tiny objects and hide under a bed for five minutes. Funny once. Not very replayable.

This project starts from a simple belief:

Prop Hunt doesn’t need more polish.
It needs more agency.

The Core Idea

This is a Prop Hunt / Capture-the-Flag hybrid designed to turn hiding into action and guessing into mind games.

Instead of a passive hide-and-seek loop, the game creates constant pressure, movement, and deception — with players always making meaningful decisions.

How the Game Actually Plays
The Flags Are on the Hunters

In this game, hunters carry the flags.

Hunters play in first-person, focused on awareness, positioning, and control of space. Props play with a more third-person view, giving them better situational awareness and the ability to plan sneaky, high-risk moves.

Props don’t win by hiding forever.

They win by getting close.

To score, a prop must sneak up behind a hunter, steal their flag, and return it to their own base — without being caught. Hunters don’t know where or when a flag will be taken, which means every sound, movement, or shadow could be a threat.

Hunters aren’t searching for static objects.
They’re protecting themselves.

Props Must Play Actively

Props can’t just shrink into the smallest object and wait out the clock.

Objectives force props to:

- move

- take risks

- bluff and misdirect

- choose the right moment to strike

Hiding still matters — but staying hidden forever doesn’t win games.

Death Isn’t the End: Guardian Angels

When a player dies — whether they’re a prop or a hunter — they don’t become a spectator.

They become a Guardian Angel.

Guardian Angels exist outside the main hunt and actively influence the match by:

granting powerups

spawning decoys

enabling traps

temporarily shifting momentum

This keeps every player involved for the entire match and prevents the game from collapsing into downtime or waiting. The player count always matters, even after death.

Deception, Not Guessing

The fun comes from misdirection, not randomness.

Fake pushes

Decoys that look real

Tracer shots meant to bait

Traps that punish overconfidence

Absurd weapons that change how players think, not just how much damage they deal

Nobody ever has perfect information — and that’s intentional.

The best moments happen when someone gets bold, greedy, clever, or unlucky.

What This Game Is Trying to Be

This project isn’t trying to turn Prop Hunt into a hyper-competitive shooter.

It’s trying to:

remove the boredom

keep the comedy

reward clever play

create chaos that feels earned, not random

The systems are designed so that surprising moments emerge naturally from player decisions — not from scripted gimmicks.

If you’re looking for a game where:

props stay active

hunters stay engaged

death doesn’t mean waiting

and the funniest moments come from players outsmarting each other

You’re in the right place.
